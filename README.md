# tame-impala-cv
One of my friends said to me, "I'd love to be able to walk into a room and start moving my hips to Tame Impala, and music will start playing in sync with my hips." I thought it was a great idea so I tried to do a quick implementation with OpenCV. It is definitely still a work in progress...
